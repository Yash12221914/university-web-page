                    Employment opportunities are also optimistic if you could achieve credit above.

                <p>Studying at UOW is the best lifestyle I could have imagined for myself; you have everything you could possibly need.
                    Wollongong itself is a great town which accommodates the uni student, plenty of part time work for those who need it, as well as accommodation options.
                    Transport to the uni is so easy with the free shuttle bus, trains or even walking there.                    
                    Highly recommend.</p>
